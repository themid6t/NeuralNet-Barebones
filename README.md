# Neural Network from scratch

This repository contains a basic implementation of a neural network from scratch. The purpose of this project is to provide a simple example of how a neural network can be implemented using basic Python libraries.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NeuralNet-Barebones.git
   ```
   
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

3. **Build a Neural network**:
   - Create a new notebook
   - Import 

## Structure

- `model.py`: Contains the main script for building and training neural networks with a tensorflow-like API.
- `nnscratch-detailed.ipynb`: Contains a detailed walkthrough of how to build one yourself.
<!-- - `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for data preprocessing and evaluation. -->
