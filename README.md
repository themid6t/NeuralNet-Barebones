# Neural Network from Scratch

ðŸš€ **Exciting Journey into Neural Networks: Building from Scratch!** ðŸš€

Neural Networks play a pivotal role in machine learning, empowering applications such as image recognition and natural language processing. The fundamental learning steps include forward propagation, loss computation, and backpropagation. While popular libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch abstract much of this complexity, building a neural network from scratch using only NumPy provided a profound understanding of these algorithms.

ðŸ§  One of the key challenges and highlights of the project was implementing backpropagation, the backbone of neural network training. This hands-on approach illuminated the inner workings, fostering a deeper comprehension beyond library abstractions.
